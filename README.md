# Arenko FE exercise

This exercise scaffold uses [Vite](https://vite.dev/) for build and [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/) with [React Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro) and [User event](https://testing-library.com/docs/user-event/intro/) for tests. The scaffold includes a [Github Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/about-github-actions/understanding-github-actions) workflow to run build, lint and test jobs.

## Candidate instructions

- Clone the repo to your local machine.

### 2. Local development
